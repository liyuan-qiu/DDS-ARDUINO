# DDS-ARDUINO
The pin is based on the hardware https://github.com/afch/DDS-AD9910-Arduino-Shield/tree/master/Libraries .
But I only use the single tone mode and also use the profile0-7 by profile[0:2].
The code they share is most about the display and the buttons to manually control the DDS, so I just rewrite all the code.
